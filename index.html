                <p>The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties. The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.</p>

            <p>It's little wonder that when it comes to puppies, Golden Retrievers invariably leap to mind. Yes, all puppies are cute and adorable, but when it comes to Goldens, they're in a class of their own. There's something particularly heart-melting about these bundles of wriggling blond fur, with their oversized paws, soft brown eyes, alert tails and, of course, velvet floppy ears.</p>

                    <p>To keep your Golden Retriever entertained it would help to give it lots of exercise to prevent it from becoming hyperactive. Then you can keep it entertained by doing things such as training it, playing fetch or tug of war with it, giving it toys to play with, giving it chew toys, giving it puzzles to complete or you can take it to doggy daycare.

                    <p>Golden Retrievers are a breed that are meant to get quite a lot of exercise to be fully stimulated. Generally, it is recommended to exercise them for an hour per day. By doing so you should be able to get it to require less work from you for the rest of the day because it will have been stimulated by the walk.

                        Another option would be to get it to swim. Swimming is good because it is a low impact way of getting your Golden Retriever to do lots of exercise quickly.Most Golden Retrievers take to water naturally but there are some that do not. However, there are ways to get it to like swimming that I talk about here.
